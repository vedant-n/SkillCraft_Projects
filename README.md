# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Tasks
This repository contains Python scripts demonstrating various data analysis and machine learning tasks using popular libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.

Task 1: Visualizing Population Data
File: population_analysis.py

Objective: Visualize world population trends over years using matplotlib.
Steps:
Load population data from CSV.
Clean data by handling missing values.
Plot world population using an area chart and visualize distribution using histograms or bar charts based on data type.
Task 2: Titanic Dataset Analysis and Preprocessing
File: titanic_analysis.py

Objective: Analyze the Titanic dataset, handle missing values, and visualize survival statistics.
Steps:
Load Titanic dataset and explore its structure.
Handle missing values in 'age', 'fare', and 'embarked'.
Visualize survival rates by passenger class, gender, and age distribution.
Task 3: Building a Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Data
File: bank_classifier.py

Objective: Build and evaluate a decision tree classifier using bank customer data.
Steps:
Load bank dataset and preprocess categorical variables using label encoding.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train a decision tree classifier and evaluate its performance using accuracy score and classification report.
Task 4: Predicting Accident Severity Using Gradient Boosting
File: accident_analysis.py

Objective: Predict accident severity based on various factors using gradient boosting.
Steps:
Load road accident data and preprocess by encoding categorical variables.
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train a gradient boosting classifier and predict accident severity for new data points.
Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors using seaborn.
